# LAPDR

This code creates models of plasma density profile in LAPD based on methods outlined in this paper: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/citedby/10.1063/1.2722302. The approach is to derive a master equation for radial and temporal evolution of plasma density based on electron temperature profiles, models of neutral density, and some specified modes of diffusion the system obeys, and evolve the equation temporally to obtain plasma density profile at desired time and axial position.
